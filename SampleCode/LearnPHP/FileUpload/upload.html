<!--
    Some rules to follow for the HTML form above:
    - Make sure that the form uses method="post"
    - The form also needs the following attribute: enctype="multipart/form-data",
      It specifies which content-type to use when submitting the form
    - The type="file" attribute of the <input> tag shows the input field as a file-select control,
      with a "Browse" button next to the input control

    Without the requirements above, the file upload will not work.
-->

<form action="upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    Select image to upload:
    <input type="file" name="fileToUpload" id="fileToUpload">
    <input type="submit" value="Upload Image" name="submit">
</form>
