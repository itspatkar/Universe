# Namespace -
/* PHP Namespaces are the way of encapsulating items so that same names can be reused without name conflicts.
It allows you to use the same function or class name in different parts of the same program without causing a name collision.
    - Name collisions between code you create, and internal PHP classes/functions/constants or third-party classes/functions/constants.
    - Ability to alias (or shorten) Extra_Long_Names designed to alleviate the first problem, improving readability of source code.

Namespaces are declared at the beginning of a file using the namespace keyword.
